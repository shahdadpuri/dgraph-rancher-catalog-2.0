# Dgraph

[Dgraph](https://wordpress.org/)  is an open source, scalable, distributed, highly available and fast graph database, designed from ground up to be run in production.

Dgraph Documentation: https://docs.dgraph.io/

WARNING: The only ports exposed by default are the 8000 and 8080 HTTP. Both serve for the full operation of Ratel. We recommend that you never open these ports in the Firewall for the general public, as they will have access to Dgraph.

In this case you block the two ports mentioned above, make a VPN or even a tunnel with some application of the type. Or just use this Template in a Local environment and only for tests and study propose.
